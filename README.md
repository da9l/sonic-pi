#Sonic Pi
Inspired by [Sam Aaron](http://sam.aaron.name/)'s talk at Luminis DevCon I started playing around with [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) to learn some Ruby and create some music.

Everything in this repository can be considered a work in progress. I simply commit everything I create so I can look back on my learning process in the future. Feel free to take anything you like. 

You can find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/1s0gr4m) and [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/1s0gr4m)
